# Would You Rather Project

This is a Udacity project that completes one of the React nanodegree course requirements.

## Purpose

This project reinforces the course learnings for React and Redux by creating a game application. The users can navigate through various questions, post new questions and check how they compare from other mock users.

## Running the application

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
